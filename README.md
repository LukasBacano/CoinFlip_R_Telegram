# CoinFlip_R_Telegram

A script inspired by the act of flipping a coin. The main inspiration is this code:

coin <- sample(1:2,1)
if (coin == 1){
  paste0("krone")
}else{
  paste0("plat")
}

# Why use CoinFlip_R_Telegram

With this script you'll always have a coin by hand that you can flip.
It's set to be fair by default, but very easy to tweak in your favor. If youre at the bar and you feel lucky, you can use this script to bet your friends about who has the next round.
(It would obv be very unfair to tweak the numbers in your favor, but ill let it be up to you)
